# Mapping_Earthquakes
 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for a seven day period.

## Tasks
To complete this project, a URL was used for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for a seven day period. Once that is completed the data will then be added to a map.

## Approach
The approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
